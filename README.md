# hello-world
Hello, testing Github
Aha! I added something earlier online.
I am making a funny edit

And now I am experimenting with Github

Let's try updating from the online repository

What if I change the file here on my mac. Online, I add to a line

A change on line 12 you say? There are uncommitted changes offline. This shouldn't conflict, so what happens if I pull this.

add extra line offline

add another extra line, but this time, let's not commit to anything

Adding a change hopefully to experimental Branch

Making change this time to lonesome Branch
